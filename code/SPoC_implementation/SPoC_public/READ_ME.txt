Hi!

This folder contains matlab code for SPoC analysis.
In order for it to run properly, the "private" folder must be in the same folder 
that the spoc function is in. The "private" folder contains some necessary utility functions.

Please have a look at the example function (spoc_example.m). Feel free to run it several times
and to change some of the parameters in the simulation (see first few lines of the code).

I have tried to commment the functions as much as possible, so I hope the code explains itself.
If not, feel free to email me and ask. Also, if you find bugs, email me and I'll try and fix
it as fast as I can.

For further information, please read the documentation of the code.

Have fun,
Sven
