  ABSTRACT={We propose a framework for building electrophysiological predictors of single-trial motor performance variations, exemplified for SVIPT, a sequential isometric force control task suitable for hand motor rehabilitation after stroke. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 20 subjects with mean age of 53 years was recorded prior to and during 400 trials of SVIPT. They were executed within a single session with the non-dominant left hand, while receiving continuous visual feedback of the produced force trajectories. The behavioral data showed strong trial-by-trial performance variations for five clinically relevant metrics, which accounted for reaction time as well as for the smoothness and precision of the produced force trajectory. 18 out of 20 tested subjects remained after preprocessing and entered offline analysis. Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) was applied on EEG data of a short time interval prior to the start of each SVIPT trial. For 11 subjects, SPoC revealed robust oscillatory EEG subspace components, whose bandpower activity are predictive for the performance of the upcoming trial. Since SPoC may overfit to non-informative subspaces, we propose to apply three selection criteria accounting for the meaningfulness of the features. Across all subjects, the obtained components were spread along the frequency spectrum and showed a variety of spatial activity patterns. Those containing the highest level of predictive information resided in and close to the alpha band. Their spatial patterns resemble topologies reported for visual attention processes as well as those of imagined or executed hand motor tasks. In summary, we identified subject-specific single predictors that explain up to 36\% of the performance fluctuations and may serve for enhancing neuroergonomics of motor rehabilitation scenarios.}

abstract = "Introduction The power of oscillatory \{EEG\} signal components has been related to attention or mental workload. Thus it may allow to decode and track mental states related to the performance of a user on a specific task. In motor rehabilitation after stroke, knowledge about suitable or impeding brain states may be informative enough to causally influence the training performance. A prerequisite for such real-time manipulation is the ability to decode ongoing \{EEG\} signals. Solutions are provided by the field of Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) systems. We propose the application of \{BCI\} methods in the context of decoding mental states relevant for successful stroke motor rehabilitation training. Extracting oscillatory sources from a pre-trial \{EEG\} interval of the alpha band with optimized data-driven filters, we show that the sources are informative about trial-wise reaction time (RT). Methods A paradigm to assess and train hand motor function in acute and chronic stroke patients is the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT, Reis et al., 2009). Current studies have shown that motor improvements achieved using \{SVIPT\} training will generalize to a range of hand-motor tasks. We report on simulated online results of a novel EEG-tracked \{SVIPT\} system. Specifically, we explored the usefulness of alpha band (8–14&#xa0;Hz) pre-trial information (−800 to 0&#xa0;ms) to predict fluctuations of subject’s reaction times (RT) in SVIPT. Data was collected from three subjects (age 23, 25, 33) using 63 \{EEG\} channels plus 1 \{EOG\} channel. Sampled at 1&#xa0;kHz, band-filtered to 0.7–90&#xa0;Hz and sub-sampled at 500&#xa0;Hz, the data was cleaned from eye- and muscle artifacts. Oscillatory \{EEG\} components, which co-modulate in power with RT, were optimized using the novel \{SPoC\} method (Dähne et al., 2014). All results reported were computed following a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. Results For all subjects, \{SPoC\} results in alpha sources with focus on parietal-occipital channels. Fig. 1 shows the estimated probability density distributions (pdf) of the true trial-wise \{RT\} using only the 33\% of fastest and slowest trials, as predicted by the power of pre-trial \{SPoC\} sources. To derive the pdfs, \{RT\} values estimated using the power of the oscillatory component were sorted. For \{VP2\} and VP3, a slight separation between groups of fast and slow trials is observed, with left-shifted pdfs for predicted faster trials. For data of \{VP1\} a separation is not evident. The mean \{RT\} values dependent on the percentage of included quickest trials are plotted in Fig. 2. An asymptotic trend is present for \{VP2\} and VP3, which indicates, that taking only trials with the predicted shortest \{RT\} values in fact lead to shorter average RTs. Conclusion The proposed EEG-tracked \{SVIPT\} is a promising tool for the prediction of trial-wise performance. Eventually applied in an online motor rehabilitation scenario, it may be versatile to gate the start of each single trial. In the hands of therapists it may allow to make training trials either harder or easier for the subject. Acknowledgement Funded by DFG, BrainLinks-BrainTools (EXC1086). ",

  abstract = {ALS-Patienten erfahren über Jahre einen progedienten Verlust ihrer Willkür-Motorik, verursacht durch degenerative Prozesse vor allem auch in motorischen Cortex-Arealen. EEG-basierte Brain-Computer-Interfaces könnten für solche Patienten nach vollständigem Verlust ihrer motorischen Fähigkeiten ein wichtiges Kommunikations-Mittel darstellen. Bei der inzwischen über viele Jahre gewachsenen Vielfalt verschiedenster nicht-invasiver BCI-Paradigmen erwies sich das auf motorischen Intentionen basierende BCI als schnelles und bezüglich Fehlerquote robustes System. Studien mit gesunden Probanden konnten erhebliche Performance-Verbesserungen durch Wiederholung von BCI-Sitzungen aufzeigen, verbunden mit kortikalen Plastizitätsänderungen zugunsten der an motorischen Vorstellungen beteiligten Extremitäten. Ein wichtiger Aspekt ist daher die Überlegung, ob und in welchem Ausmaß Patienten mit ALS, die langjährig nicht nur teilweise sondern vollständig gelähmt sind, ein solches auf Bewegungsintentionen basierendes BCI steuern können. Wir berichten über Ergebnisse von derartigen BCI-Messungen, die wiederholt über ein Jahr an einer ALS-Patientin abgeleitet wurden, die bis auf eine minimale Restfunktion von Teilen ihrer Okulomotorik seit 15 Jahren vollständig gelähmt ist. Darin zeigte sich, dass die Patientin noch 15 Jahre nach Verlust jeder Extremitätenbewegung zwar instabil, aber wiederholbar in der Lage ist, über eine Modulation von perizentralen EEG-Rhythmen spezifische kortikale Muster zu erzeugen, die Voraussetzung für eine BCI-Klassifikation sind. EEG-Korrelate motorischer Intentionen können somit zumindest partiell trotz jahrzehntelanger vollständiger Lähmung nachweisbar bleiben und als BCI-Steuersignal nutzbar gemacht werden.}

  abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) strive to decode brain signals into control commands for severely handicapped people with no means of muscular control. These potential users of noninvasive BCIs display a large range of physical and mental conditions. Prior studies have shown the general applicability of BCI with patients, with the conflict of either using many training sessions or studying only moderately restricted patients. We present a BCI system designed to establish external control for severely motor-impaired patients within a very short time. Within only six experimental sessions, three out of four patients were able to gain significant control over the BCI, which was based on motor imagery or attempted execution. For the most affected patient, we found evidence that the BCI could outperform the best assistive technology (AT) of the patient in terms of control accuracy, reaction time and information transfer rate. We credit this success to the applied user-centered design approach and to a highly flexible technical setup. State-of-the art machine learning methods allowed the exploitation and combination of multiple relevant features contained in the EEG, which rapidly enabled the patients to gain substantial BCI control. Thus, we could show the feasibility of a flexible and tailorable BCI application in severely disabled users. This can be considered a significant success for two reasons: Firstly, the results were obtained within a short period of time, matching the tight clinical requirements. Secondly, the participating patients showed, compared to most other studies, very severe communication deficits. They were dependent on everyday use of AT and two patients were in a locked-in state. For the most affected patient a reliable communication was rarely possible with existing AT.},

    abstract = {Despite several approaches to realize subject-to-subject transfer of pre-trained classifiers, the full performance of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for a novel user can only be reached by presenting the BCI system with data from the novel user. In typical state-of-the-art BCI systems with a supervised classifier, the labeled data is collected during a calibration recording, in which the user is asked to perform a specific task. Based on the known labels of this recording, the BCI's classifier can learn to decode the individual's brain signals. Unfortunately, this calibration recording consumes valuable time. Furthermore, it is unproductive with respect to the final BCI application, e.g. text entry. Therefore, the calibration period must be reduced to a minimum, which is especially important for patients with a limited concentration ability. The main contribution of this manuscript is an online study on unsupervised learning in an auditory event-related potential (ERP) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the calibration recording can be bypassed by utilizing an unsupervised trained classifier, that is initialized randomly and updated during usage. Initially, the unsupervised classifier tends to make decoding mistakes, as the classifier might not have seen enough data to build a reliable model. Using a constant re-analysis of the previously spelled symbols, these initially misspelled symbols can be rectified posthoc when the classifier has learned to decode the signals. We compare the spelling performance of our unsupervised approach and of the unsupervised posthoc approach to the standard supervised calibration-based dogma for n = 10 healthy users. To assess the learning behavior of our approach, it is unsupervised trained from scratch three times per user. Even with the relatively low SNR of an auditory ERP paradigm, the results show that after a limited number of trials (30 trials), the unsupervised approach performs comparably to a classic supervised model.},

  abstract={Objective. Most BCIs have to undergo a calibration session in which data is recorded to train decoders with machine learning. Only recently zero-training methods have become a subject of study. This work proposes a probabilistic framework for BCI applications which exploit event-related potentials (ERPs). For the example of a visual P300 speller we show how the framework harvests the structure suitable to solve the decoding task by (a) transfer learning, (b) unsupervised adaptation, (c) language model and (d) dynamic stopping. Approach. A simulation study compares the proposed probabilistic zero framework (using transfer learning and task structure) to a state-of-the-art supervised model on n = 22 subjects. The individual influence of the involved components (a)–(d) are investigated. Main results. Without any need for a calibration session, the probabilistic zero-training framework with inter-subject transfer learning shows excellent performance—competitive to a state-of-the-art supervised method using calibration. Its decoding quality is carried mainly by the effect of transfer learning in combination with continuous unsupervised adaptation. Significance. A high-performing zero-training BCI is within reach for one of the most popular BCI paradigms: ERP spelling. Recording calibration data for a supervised BCI would require valuable time which is lost for spelling. The time spent on calibration would allow a novel user to spell 29 symbols with our unsupervised approach. It could be of use for various clinical and non-clinical ERP-applications of BCI.},

  abstract={Objective. EEG artifacts of non-neural origin can be separated from neural signals by independent component analysis (ICA). It is unclear (1) how robustly recently proposed artifact classifiers transfer to novel users, novel paradigms or changed electrode setups, and (2) how artifact cleaning by a machine learning classifier impacts the performance of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). Approach . Addressing (1), the robustness of different strategies with respect to the transfer between paradigms and electrode setups of a recently proposed classifier is investigated on offline data from 35 users and 3 EEG paradigms, which contain 6303 expert-labeled components from two ICA and preprocessing variants. Addressing (2), the effect of artifact removal on single-trial BCI classification is estimated on BCI trials from 101 users and 3 paradigms. Main results . We show that (1) the proposed artifact classifier generalizes to completely different EEG paradigms. To obtain similar results under massively reduced electrode setups, a proposed novel strategy improves artifact classification. Addressing (2), ICA artifact cleaning has little influence on average BCI performance when analyzed by state-of-the-art BCI methods. When slow motor-related features are exploited, performance varies strongly between individuals, as artifacts may obstruct relevant neural activity or are inadvertently used for BCI control. Significance . Robustness of the proposed strategies can be reproduced by EEG practitioners as the method is made available as an EEGLAB plug-in.},
